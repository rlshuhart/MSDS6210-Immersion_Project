    "The below is from how the orginal studin in \"Closing the Gap: Reducing Racial and Ethnic Disparities\" was conducted:\n",
    "\n",
    "   This brief draws on the 2012–2013 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS), an annual survey conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in partnership with state governments. The surveys included landline and cellular telephone interviews with more than 400,000 adults age 18 and older across all 50 states. In performing our analysis, we combined two years of data to ensure an adequate sample size in each of the socioeconomic strata, including income, race and ethnicity, and insurance status. <font color=\"red\">We restricted our analysis to adults under age 65. </font>\n",
    "   BRFSS asks adults whether they did not visit a doctor when needed within the previous 12 months because of costs, and whether they have one or more than one person they think of as their personal doctor or health care provider.\n",
    "    Our analysis classifies respondents’ socioeconomic (SES) characteristics as follows:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    • Race/ethnicity: white (non-Hispanic), black (non-Hispanic), or Hispanic (any race).\n",
    "    • Income in three income groups:\n",
    "      1. Low income: below 200 percent of the federal poverty level (income in 2012 of less than $22,340 if single, or \n",
    "      less than $46,100 for a family of four).\n",
    "      2. Middle income: 200 percent to 399 percent of poverty (income in 2012 of $22,340 up to $44,680 if single, or \n",
    "      $46,100 to $92,200 for a family of four).\n",
    "      3. Higher income: 400 percent of poverty or higher (income in 2012 at or above $44,680 if single, or $92,200 for \n",
    "      a family of four).\n",
    "    • Insurance status: insured or not at the time of the questionnaire.\n",
    "    \n",
    "        Exhibit 2 reports unadjusted point estimates, stratified by race/ethnicity. Exhibits 3 and 4 report adjusted means, to account for differences in respondents’ age, sex, income, and health status. We adjusted estimates using survey-design adjusted logistic regressions in Stata (v.12.1).\n",
    "    \n",
    "        Unadjusted point estimates were still subject to uncertainty because of the sample design. Each estimate has survey design–adjusted 95 percent confidence intervals of about 1 to 2 percentage points. Statistical significance associated with SES-adjusted point estimates is noted in Exhibits 3 and 4."
